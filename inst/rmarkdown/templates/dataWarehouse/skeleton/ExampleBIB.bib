@article{BrownTrawl,
abstract = {Abstract: The effects of commercial bottom trawling on the physical environment were investigated in a sandy habitat at ∼26-m water depth in the southeastern Bering Sea. We compared an area closed to trawling for 10 years with an adjacent commercial fishery area, examined the immediate effects of experimental trawling on sediment properties, and compared bottom trawling to natural disturbance by waves. The sediments in the top 3cm of the fished area were slightly better sorted, less variable, and contained fewer fine grains than those of the closed area. Relative to controls, no shift in means was detected immediately after experimental trawling, but significant increases in variability occurred for several grain size and organic matter parameters. Wave disturbance to the study area was persistent and of greater magnitude than disturbance associated with commercial trawling. However, the trawl season occurred at a time of year when sediment resuspension by waves was diminished. PrevioPrevious work suggested that such trawling-related factors have important biological consequences and account for the different benthic communities observed between trawled and closed areas. Given the physical setting, it is difficult to explain our subtle but significant results by purely physical processes. We hypothesize that the differences in sediment characteristics could result from a biological feedback process, where trawling results in different communities which in turn result in different sediment mixing and bioturbation rates, thereby influencing grain size parameters and labile carbon distributions. Functional differences in the benthic communities are consistent with the observed differences in sedimentary characteristics. This study is unique in identifying potential trawling effects in sandy high-energy environments, and suggests that interactions between physical and biological processes should be addressed in future studies.},

@article{TillingTrawl,
abstract = {Bottom trawling causes widespread physical disturbance of sediments in seas and oceans and affects benthic communities by removing target and non-target species and altering habitats. One aspiration of the ecosystem approach to management is to conserve function as well as biodiversity, but trawling impacts on benthic community function need to be understood before they can be managed. Here we present the large scale and long term impact of chronic trawling on the functional composition of benthic invertebrate communities using a comprehensive set of functional traits. The effects of chronic trawling disturbance on the functional composition of faunal benthic invertebrate communities, as sampled with a small beam trawl, were investigated at 6 to 13 sites in each of 4 contrasting regions of the North Sea. Each site was subject to known levels of trawling disturbance. Information on the life history and ecological function traits of the taxa sampled was translated into fuzzy coding and used to analyse the relationship between life history and functional roles within the ecosystem. Multivariate analyses were used to examine changes in the distribution of traits over gradients of trawling intensity. Changes in the functional structure of the community due to the effects of long-term trawling were identified in 3 of the 4 areas sampled. Filter-feeding, attached and larger animals were relatively more abundant in lightly trawled areas, while areas with higher levels of trawling were characterised by a higher relative biomass of mobile animals and infaunal and scavenging invertebrates. Univariate analysis of selected traits confirmed the patterns observed in multivariate analysis. These results demonstrate that chronic bottom trawling can lead to large scale shifts in the functional composition of benthic communities, with likely effects on the functioning of coastal ecosystems},

We used a comparative approach to test the hypothesis that persistent otter trawling decreases bottom habitat complexity and biodiversity, increases the abundance of opportunistic species, and benefits prey important in the diet of some commercially valuable fish. We compared two similar and adjacent fishing areas at 180 m off central California in Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary: one inside the three-mile coastal zone of restricted fishing with light levels of trawling and one beyond the three-mile limit with high levels of trawling.

abstract = {We conducted a 3-year experiment on the effects of otter trawling on benthic habitat and communities on a sandy-bottom ecosystem of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland that has supported commercial fisheries. Each year, three 13-km-long corridors were trawled 12 times with an Engel 145 otter trawl, creating a disturbance zone 120–250 m wide. Using a variety of oceanographic instruments, measurements were made before and after trawling to document effects. Trawling had no detectable effect on sediment grain size. Tracks made by trawl doors were readily visible on the sea floor immediately after trawling and 10 weeks later; in some cases they were still faintly visible after 1 year. Acoustic data indicated that trawling increased the topographic relief or roughness of surficial sediments and changed small-scale biogenic sediment structures down to depths of 4.5 cm. Video observations in trawled corridors revealed that organisms and shells tended to be organized into linear features parallel},

@article{Krost1990,
abstract = {The effects of otter-trawl fishery on nutrient release from the sediment and macrofauna of Kieler Bucht (Western Baltic) was investigated. The dimension of the impact by otter-board fishery on the sediment was estimated by side-scan sonar and underwater video. Only the otter boards imprint distinctive and long-lasting marks at the sea bottom. By the use of underwater video the depth of these tracks was estimated as about 5 cm on muddy sand, about 10 cm on sandy mud and about 15 cm on mud. The width of the tracks is usually around 0.8 m. A mapping of the otter-board tracks in the study area using side-scan sonar showed that the areas of highest trawl-track frequency coincide with muddy sediments. An approximation of fishery effort resulted in an area of 333 sq km annually disturbed by otter boards. The total area trawled per year (including all parts of the otter-trawl gear) is about 10 times larger. Resuspension experiments in bell jars showed, that the spontaneous nutrient release from the sediment by resuspension equals the total amount of nutrients in the pore water of the resuspended sediment. Additionally, nutrients will be released by subsequent re-adjustion of the pore water gradients in the sediment to the previous profile. Undisturbed porewater profiles were measured for the sediment types relevant for otter-board fishery, i.e. muddy sand, sandy mud and mud. By these profiles diffusional fluxes of nutrients from the sediment into the water column were calculated: on sandy mud they are 378 Řmol/sq m/d silicate, 314 Řmol/sq m/d ammonia and 18 Řmol/sq m/d phosphate, while on mud they are 847 Řmol/sq m/d silicate, 613 Řmol/sq m/d ammonia and 89 Řmol/sq m/d phosphate. For the area of 333 sq km annually disturbed by otter boards an additional mobilization of 200-822 t silicon, 98-435 t nitrogen and 34-167 t phosphorus was calculated, as well as an annual oxygen demand of 491-2656 t oxygen due to the release of hydrogen-sulphide by sediment resuspension. Effects of otter-trawl fishery on benthic macrofauna was studied by comparison of samples from new trawl tracks with undisturbed samples. Samples of extensively fished areas were compared with samples from control areas of similar sediments and water depth. An experiment was performed to study the damage of benthic animals suffered by an otter-board passage. In the channel system in Kieler Bucht the fishery effort is strong enough to induce considerable changes of the benthic community. Endofauna is more affected than epifauna, abundance more then biomass. The most abundant animals are predominantly reduced, resulting in often even higher evenness and diversity than in undisturbed areas. By pre-running water pressure and subsequent suction, the passage of otter boards results mainly in resuspension of sediment and animals living within, only a smaller portion of animals collide directly with the otter board. Especially spherical and compact molluscs have a good chance to survive an otter-board passage},

@article{TrawlBiochem,
abstract = {Bottom trawling causes physical disturbance to sediments particularly in shelf areas. The disturbance due to trawling is most significant in deeper areas with softer sediments where levels of natural disturbance due to wave and tidal action are low. In heavily fished areas, trawls may impact the same area of seabed more than four times per year. A single pass of a beam trawl, the heaviest gear routinely used in shelf sea fisheries, can kill 5-65{\%} of the resident fauna and mix the top few cm of sediment. We expect that sediment community function, carbon mineralisation and biogeochemical fluxes will be strongly affected by trawling activity because the physical effects of trawling are equivalent to those of an extreme bioturbator, and yet, unlike bioturbating macrofauna, trawling does not directly contribute to community metabolism. We used an existing box-model of a generalised soft sediment system to examine the effects of trawling disturbance on carbon mineralisation and chemical concentrations. We contrasted the effects of a natural scenario, where bioturbation is a function of macrobenthos biomass, with an anthropogenic impact scenario where physical disturbance results from trawling rather than the action of bioturbating macrofauna. Simulation results suggest that the effects of low levels of trawling disturbance will be similar to those of natural bioturbators but that high levels of trawling disturbance prevent the modelled system from reaching equilibrium due to large carbon fluxes between oxic and anoxic carbon compartments. The presence of macrobenthos in the natural disturbance scenario allowed sediment chemical storage and fluxes to reach equilibrium. This is because the macrobenthos are important carbon consumers in the system whose presence reduces the magnitude of available carbon fluxes. In soft sediment systems, where the level physical disturbance due to waves and tides is low, model results suggest that intensive trawling disturbance could cause large fluctuations in benthic chemical fluxes and storage},

The observed attack angles of the board measured' by photographs were almost the same as the theoretical angles calculated from the positions of bracket and normans on the board when the drag of net was varied. From ANOVA, it is clear that the observed attack angles are not significantly different from the theoretical angles of the board. The horizontal spread of the otter board decreased with the increase of the drag of net when the linking positions of a warp on the bracket and hand ropes on the normans were the same.

abstract = {One billion people depend on seafood as their primary source of protein and 25{\%} of the world's total animal protein comes from fisheries. Yet a third of fish stocks worldwide are overexploited or depleted. Using individual case studies, many have argued that community-based co-management should prevent the tragedy of the commons because cooperative management by fishers, managers and scientists often results in sustainable fisheries. However, general and multidisciplinary evaluations of co-management regimes and the conditions for social, economic and ecological success within such regimes are lacking. Here we examine 130 co-managed fisheries in a wide range of countries with different degrees of development, ecosystems, fishing sectors and type of resources. We identified strong leadership as the most important attribute contributing to success, followed by individual or community quotas, social cohesion and protected areas. Less important conditions included enforcement mechanisms, long-term management policies and life history of the resources. Fisheries were most successful when at least eight co-management attributes were present, showing a strong positive relationship between the number of these attributes and success, owing to redundancy in management regulations. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of prominent community leaders and robust social capital, combined with clear incentives through catch shares and conservation benefits derived from protected areas, for successfully managing aquatic resources and securing the livelihoods of communities depending on them. Our study offers hope that co-management, the only realistic solution for the majority of the world's fisheries, can solve many of the problems facing global fisheries.},

@techreport{Valdemarsen2007,
abstract = {Bottom trawling is a diversified fishing method which uses numerous types of gear designs, sizes, rigging and operational methods. Therefore, impact on the bottom habitat will differ among the various bottom trawl fisheries and also to a large extent depend on the bottom conditions in the area fished. During bottom trawling the primary function of the forward parts of the trawl is to maintain bottom contact, provide spread and herd the target species. These parts are the trawl doors, sweeps and bridles, and are essential for proper gear performance and capture efficiency. This document describes the basic principles that can be used to reduce the impact of trawling, some of which are already developed as practical solutions and implemented in commercial fisheries. Overall, however, there are presently few examples of low bottom-impact trawl gears in use in commercial fisheries. These basic mitigation measures aim at reducing pressure on the bottom of various trawl components and minimizing the impacted area while trawling. Implementation of reduced bottom-impact solutions may result in reduced capture efficiency for target species and acceptance of the technology by the fishing industry in their commercial fishing activity might therefore be difficult. Thus, research communities face many challenges to further develop bottom habitat friendly options.},
